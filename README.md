# Hi, we have created this Software to enhance the business of CROMA 

**Problem 1: Finding the best locations for establishing new croma stores (given a city name) :-**
- The software divides the city houses and buildings into some clusters (distance based) and finds 4-5  empty land regions nearby highways and main roads in each cluster.
- The top 4-5 spots are chosen based on the shortest distance from city airport or railway station.

**Problem 2: Demand forecasting for CROMA stores (given a region , duration and category):-**
- The software calculates the no. of festive days and normal days in given duration, average sales in festive as well as normal days using past sales data.
- TOTAL PRODUCTS = (Festive days)x(avg sales in festive day) + (normal days)x(avg sales in normal day).
- Scrape trending product data from websites. Using this data and above data, the AI agents collaboratively finds the best forecast for the relevant products based on city demands. (a high tier city requires more premium quality products where as low tier city requires budget friendly options)

**Problem 3: Enhancing customer shopping and after buying experience :-**
- The software suggests the best time for marketing communications just before the festive season in the region.
- The software helps user to search for the most relevant product according to his requirements using a chatbot. The chatbot asks users questions on his works and requirements, and generates a list of specifications required to cater his needs.
- According to the specifications, the software searches the specified filters from the available options.
- User can query the chatbot to change the requirements (eg :- show low priced products for similar specifications)

**FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES**
- AFTER BUYING EXPERIENCE : The software will suggest the customer relevant questions to ask from the chatbot regarding the setup and usage of bought product. The chatbot (Gemini) uses "CROMA UNBOXED" articles to answer the user questions
- OPTIMAL DELIVERY: Assigns delivery vehicle for each order.
